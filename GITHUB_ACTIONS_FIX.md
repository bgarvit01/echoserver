## Issue Fixed
The documentation pipeline was failing with this error:
```
Error: This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`.

```

## ✅ Actions Updated

  uses: actions/configure-pages@v3

- name: Upload artifact
  uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2

```yaml
- name: Create Release

```
